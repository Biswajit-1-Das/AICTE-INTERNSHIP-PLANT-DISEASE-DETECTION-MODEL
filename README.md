# AICTE-INTERNSHIP-PLANT-DISEASE-DETECTION-MODEL

**Overview:** This project involves building a machine learning-based system to identify plant
diseases and recommend suitable crops and fertilizers. The system processes images of plant
leaves to detect symptoms of diseases. It also takes into account environmental factors such as
soil quality and weather conditions to optimize crop productivity.

**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Machine Learning, Image Processing

**Applications:**
● Precision agriculture
● Automated disease monitoring
● Crop yield optimization
● Sustainable farming practices
